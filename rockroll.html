    Do you REALLY need SSR? React is a powerful framework for updating and
    rendering HTML on a user's device. It revolutionized the way we write render
    logic by sending a giant JavaScript bundle to the user's device that could
    both render the HTML and also update it as things change. Before React, we
    had a thing called templating languages, and libraries, and frameworks with
    their own template systems and it was chaos. You would write your HTML first
    and then you would ship JavaScript to change what the HTML did, and update
    it after it loaded. But you had separate steps for building the HTML and
    templates and then for the JavaScript that updates them after. When we have
    a page with tweets, like on Twitter's homepage, we would first need to
    figure out who the user is and what posts we should show them. We do that by
    fetching from the database on the server. Then, we use that data to generate
    some HTML and send that to the user so they can see their posts. But what
    happens when they make a new post? Before frameworks like React and before
    the AJAX revolution of client-side JavaScript running requests, every post
    or new event on the web would fire a full web request, and refresh the
    entire page, generating entirely new HTML. React made it easier to do all of
    that on client, and just send JSON blobs back and forth instead. However,
    this came with a cost. The first cost is the client-side performance hit,
    because the server is not rendering HTML to users' devices anymore. Now, the
    user's device is responsible for a lot more work. On top of that, metadata,
    tags, and all the fancy things that robots crawl and get when you post on
    Twitter, or on Google, or on Discord/Slack require that the HTML file is not
    empty. Another cost is that you have to build your own separate system to
    generate unique HTML for every page, and you have to build a full separate
    API to actually get the data to the client to render on the mobile device.
    Previously, when you built HTML and templates on the server with the
    original model, HTML was static, and it did not change. If you want your
    HTML to change, you need something like JavaScript to update the HTML. So,
    we have two options: We can have an HTML file with nothing in it, and then
    the JavaScript does everything on the user's device, or we generate the HTML
    fully on the server, and then the client updates it from there. Server-Side
    Rendering (SSR) is a modern approach to rendering web pages on server-side
    before serving them to the userâ€™s mobile devices. SSR means generating
    dynamic web pages on server-side while keeping JavaScripts functionalities
    of client-side updates and interactivity intact. A lot of people would argue
    what we had previously is SSR, which is rendering a page by the server but
    just generating HTML. What
